## Lab1 - Creating Distributed Services

In this step, we'll install a sample application into the system. This application
is included in Istio itself for demonstrating various aspects of it, but the application
isn't tied exclusively to Istio - it's an ordinary microservice application that could be
installed to any OpenShift instance with or without Istio.

The sample application is called _Bookinfo_, a simple application that displays information about a
book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a
description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The BookInfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

* **productpage** - The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
* **details** - The details microservice contains book information.
* **reviews** - The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
* **ratings** - The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 does not call the ratings service.
* Version v2 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
* Version v3 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below.

####1. Deploy Bookinfo Application

---

Change the empty **USERXX Bookinfo** project via CodeReady Workspace **Terminal** and you should replace **userxx** with your username:

`oc project userxx-bookinfo`

Deploy the **Bookinfo application** in the bookinfo project:

`oc apply -f cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/bookinfo.yaml`

Replace your onw gateway URL with **REPLACE WITH YOUR BOOKINFO APP URL** in **bookinfo-gateway.yaml**.

 * URL format: userXX-bookinfo-istio-system.<ROUTE SUBFFIX>
 * URL example: user1-bookinfo-istio-system.apps.seoul-bfcf.openshiftworkshop.com

![gateway]({% image_path bookinfo-gateway.png %})

Create the **ingress gateway** for Bookinfo:

`oc apply -f cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/bookinfo-gateway.yaml`

The application consists of the usual objects like Deployments, Services, and Routes.

As part of the installation, we use Istio to "decorate" the application with additional
components (the Envoy Sidecars you read about in the previous step).

Let's wait for our application to finish deploying. Go to the overview page in **userxx BookInfo Service Mesh** project:

![bookinfo]({% image_path bookinfo-deployed.png %})

Or you can execute the following commands to wait for the deployment to complete and result **successfully rolled out**:

~~~shell
oc rollout status -w deployment/productpage-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v2 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v3 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/details-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/ratings-v1
~~~

Confirm that Bookinfo has been **successfully** deployed via your own **Gateway URL**:

`curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://user1-bookinfo-istio-system.apps.seoul-bfcf.openshiftworkshop.com/productpage`

You should get **200** as a response.

Add default destination rules:

`oc apply -f cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/destination-rule-all.yaml`

List all available destination rules:

`oc get destinationrules -o yaml`

####2. Access Bookinfo

Open the application in your browser to make sure it's working:

* Bookinfo Application running with your own **Gateway URL** at 

`http://user1-bookinfo-istio-system.apps.seoul-bfcf.openshiftworkshop.com/productpage`

It should look something like:

![Bookinfo App]({% image_path bookinfo.png %})

Reload the page multiple times. The three different versions of the Reviews service
show the star ratings differently - `v1` shows no stars at all, `v2` shows black stars,
and `v3` shows red stars:

* `v1`: ![no stars]({% image_path stars-none.png %})
* `v2`: ![black stars]({% image_path stars-black.png %})
* `v3`: ![red stars]({% image_path stars-red.png %})

That's because there are 3 versions of reviews deployment for our reviews service. Istioâ€™s
load-balancer is using a _round-robin_ algorithm to iterate through the 3 instances of this service.

You should now have your OpenShift Pods running and have an Envoy sidecar in each of them
alongside the microservice. The microservices are productpage, details, ratings, and
reviews. Note that you'll have three versions of the reviews microservice:

`oc get pods --selector app=reviews`

~~~shell
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
reviews-v1-7754bbd88-dm4s5    2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v2-69fd995884-qpddl   2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v3-5f9d5bbd8-sz29k    2/2     Running   0          12m
~~~

Notice that each of the microservices shows `2/2` containers ready for each service (one for the service and one for its
sidecar).

Now that we have our application deployed and linked into the Istio service mesh, let's take a look at the
immediate value we can get out of it without touching the application code itself!

#####Congratulations!
