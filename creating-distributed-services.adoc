== Lab 1 - Creating Distributed Services

In this step, we’ll install a sample application into the system. This
application is included in Istio itself for demonstrating various
aspects of it, but the application isn’t tied exclusively to Istio -
it’s an ordinary microservice application that could be installed to any
OpenShift instance with or without Istio.

The sample application is called _Bookinfo_, a simple application that
displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of
an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the
book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book
reviews.

The BookInfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

* *productpage* - The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and
`reviews` microservices to populate the page.
* *details* - The `details` microservice contains book information.
* *reviews* - The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also
calls the `ratings` microservice to show a ``star'' rating for each
book.
* *ratings* - The `ratings` microservice contains book rating
information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version `v1` does not call the ratings service.
* Version `v2` calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1
to 5 *black* stars.
* Version `v3` calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1
to 5 *red* stars.

The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below.

Architecture]

####1. Deploy Bookinfo Application

'''''

First, open a new browser with the
link:{{ CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift web
console, window="_blank"]

image::openshift_login.png[openshift_login]

Login using:

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `r3dh4t1!`


[IMPORTANT]
====
When you access the link:{{ CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift web
console] or other URLs via _HTTPS_ protocol, you will see browser
warnings like `Your Connection is not secure` since this workshop uses
self-signed certificates (which you should not do in production!). For
example, if you’re using *Chrome*, to accept the warning, Click on
`Advanced` then `Proceed to...` to access the page.
====

images/browser_warning.png[warning]


Other browsers have similar procedures to accept the security exception.


Once logged in, uou will see the OpenShift landing page:

image::openshift_landing.png[openshift_landing]


The project displayed in the landing page depends on which labs you will
run today. If you will develop `Service Mesh and Identity` then you will
see pre-created projects as the above screeenshot.


Although your Eclipse Che workspace is running on the Kubernetes
cluster, it’s running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that
prevents you from creating most resource types. If you’ve completed
other modules, you’re probably already logged in, but let’s login again:
open a Terminal and issue the following command:

`oc login https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true`

Enter your username and password assigned to you:

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `r3dh4t1!`

You should see like:

[source,shell]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * default
    istio-system
    {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo
    {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
    {{ USER_ID }}-cloudnative-pipeline
    {{ USER_ID }}-cloudnativeapps
    {{ USER_ID }}-inventory

Using project "default".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

Change to the empty *{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo* project via CodeReady
Workspaces Terminal and this command (you should replace *{{ USER_ID
}}* with your username):

`oc project {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo`

Deploy the *Bookinfo application* in the bookinfo project:

`oc apply -f /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/bookinfo.yaml`

Next, open the `istio/bookinfo-gateway.yaml` file in CodeReady.

Look for the _REPLACE WITH YOUR BOOKINFO APP URL_ (there are 2 of them)
and replace them with your custom url:

`{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo-istio-system.{{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}`

image::bookinfo-gateway.png[gateway]

[TIP]
====
Be sure to substitute your username for `{{ USER_ID }}`!
====


And then create the _ingress gateway_ for Bookinfo:

`oc apply -f /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/bookinfo-gateway.yaml`

For your conveience, set an environment variable in the CodeReady
Workspaces Terminal:

`echo "export BOOK_URL=REPLACE WITH YOUR BOOKINFO APP URL" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`
(again, replace the same value as above).

When the app is installed, each Pod will get an additional _sidecar_
container as described earlier.

Let’s wait for our application to finish deploying. Go to the overview
page in _{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo_ project:

image::bookinfo-deployed.png[bookinfo]

Or you can execute the following commands to wait for the deployment to
complete and result `successfully rolled out`:

[source,shell]
----
oc rollout status -w deployment/productpage-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v2 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v3 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/details-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/ratings-v1
----

Confirm that Bookinfo has been *successfully* deployed via your own
_Gateway URL_:

`curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://$BOOK_URL/productpage`

You should get *200* as a response.

Add default destination rules (we’ll alter this later to affect routing
of requests):

`oc apply -f /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/destination-rule-all.yaml`

List all available destination rules:

`oc get destinationrules -o yaml`

####2. Access Bookinfo

Open the application in your web browser to make sure if it’s working.
You will find the URL via running the following command in CodeReady
Workspaces Terminal:

`echo http://$BOOK_URL/productpage`

It should look something like:

image::bookinfo.png[Bookinfo App]

Reload the page multiple times. The three different versions of the
Reviews service show the star ratings differently - _v1_ shows no stars
at all, _v2_ shows black stars, and _v3_ shows red stars:

* *v1*: image::stars-none.png[no stars]
* *v2*: image::stars-black.png[black stars]
* *v3*: image::stars-red.png[red stars]

That’s because there are 3 versions of reviews deployment for our
reviews service. Istio’s load-balancer is using a _round-robin_
algorithm to iterate through the 3 instances of this service.

You should now have your OpenShift Pods running and have an Envoy
sidecar in each of them alongside the microservice. The microservices
are productpage, details, ratings, and reviews. Note that you’ll have
three versions of the reviews microservice:

`oc get pods --selector app=reviews`

[source,shell]
----
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
reviews-v1-7754bbd88-dm4s5    2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v2-69fd995884-qpddl   2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v3-5f9d5bbd8-sz29k    2/2     Running   0          12m
----

Notice that each of the microservices shows *2/2* containers ready for
each service (one for the service and one for its sidecar).

Now that we have our application deployed and linked into the Istio
service mesh, let’s take a look at the immediate value we can get out of
it without touching the application code itself!

##### Congratulations!
