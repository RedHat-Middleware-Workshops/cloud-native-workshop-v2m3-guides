= Creating Distributed Services
:experimental:

In this lab, we’ll install a sample application into the system. This application is included in Istio itself for demonstrating various aspects of it, but the application isn’t tied exclusively to Istio - it’s an ordinary microservice application that could be installed to any OpenShift instance with or without Istio.

The sample application is called _Bookinfo_, a simple application that displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The BookInfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

<1> *productpage* - The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and
`reviews` microservices to populate the page.
<2> *details* - The `details` microservice contains book information.
<3> *reviews* - The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also
calls the `ratings` microservice to show a ``star'' rating for each
book.
<4> *ratings* - The `ratings` microservice contains book rating
information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

<1> Version `v1` does not call the ratings service.
<2> Version `v2` calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1
to 5 *black* stars.
<3> Version `v3` calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1
to 5 *red* stars.

The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below.

Before we start depoying our application we need to make sure we have the right access to our different application namespaces. The _ServiceMeshControlPlane_ that includes _Elasticsearch_, _Jaeger_, _Kiali_ and _Service Mesh Operators_, have all been installed at the cluster provisioning time. However for applications to communicate to each other accross different namespaces, we need to ensure that the _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ is also created. We create the _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ with the following yaml file. 

[source, yaml, role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-istio-system <1>
spec:
  members:
    - {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo <2>
    - {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
    - {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

So what's really happening in this yaml construct? 

<1> is the istio-system namespace which will hold are _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ and a bunch of other service mesh related objects. 
<2> is the list of projects that will be part of this _ServiceMesh_; in our case that's the our application.  

Let's create the _ServiceMeshMemberRole_

- Login to the openshift console link:{{CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift web console, window="_blank"]
- Press the plus sign on the right top corner as shown in the picture. 

image::plussigntop_ocpconsole.png[Run yaml in console]

- Select your namespace `{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system` on the top right; as shown in the picture and paste the above _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ yaml file into the editor. 

image::smmr_yaml_create.png[Run yaml in console]

- Press create. This should create the required _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ 

Now let's click `Home -> Explore` in the openshift webconsole and verify where the _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ was created. 
Click on the _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ and then select your project user5-istio-system and you will see the newly create role. 

image::smmr_explore.png[SMMR Explore]

Congratulations now we have successfully configured _ServiceMeshMemberRole_ let's move on to deploy our application to our service mesh. 


#### 1. Deploy Bookinfo Application

'''''

First, open a new browser with the link:{{ CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift web console, window="_blank"]

image::openshift_login.png[openshift_login]

Login using:

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `r3dh4t1!`


[NOTE]
====
When you access the link:{{ CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift web console] or other URLs via _HTTPS_ protocol, you might see browser warnings like `Your Connection is not secure` since this workshop uses self-signed certificates (which you should not do in production!). For example, if you’re using *Chrome*, to accept the warning, Click on `Advanced` then `Proceed to...` to access the page.
====

image::browser_warning.png[warning]


Other browsers have similar procedures to accept the security exception.

You will see a list of projects to which you have access:

Once logged in, you should see the OpenShift landing page:

image::openshift_landing.png[openshift_landing]


The project displayed on the landing page depends on which labs you will run today. If you will develop `Service Mesh and Identity` then you will see pre-created projects as shown in the above screeenshot.

Although your CodeReady workspace is running on the Kubernetes cluster, it’s running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that prevents you from creating most resource types. If you’ve completed other modules, you’re probably already logged in, but let’s login again. Open a Terminal and issue the following command:


[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc login https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----

Enter your username and password assigned to you:

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `r3dh4t1!`

You should see a similar output as follows:

[source,none]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo
    {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
    {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
    {{ USER_ID }}-istio-system

Using project "{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

Let's change to our working project *{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo* ; Open a terminal via CodeReady
Workspaces and run the following commands 

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo
oc apply -f /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/bookinfo.yaml
----

Following should be your bookinfo app URL.

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
http://{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo-istio-system.{{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/productpage
----


image::bookinfo-gateway.png[gateway]

And then create the _ingress gateway_ for Bookinfo:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -f /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
----

For your conveience, set an environment variable in the CodeReady
Workspaces Terminal:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
echo "export BOOK_URL={{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo-istio-system.{{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
----

When the app is installed, each Pod will get an additional _sidecar_
container as described earlier.

Let’s wait for our application to finish deploying. Go to the overview
page in _{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo_ project:

image::bookinfo-deployed.png[bookinfo]

Or you can execute the following commands to wait for the deployment to
complete and result `successfully rolled out`:

[source,shell]
----
 oc rollout status -w deployment/productpage-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v2 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/reviews-v3 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/details-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -w deployment/ratings-v1
----

Confirm that Bookinfo has been *successfully* deployed via your own
_Gateway URL_:
[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo-istio-system.{{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/productpage
----

You should get *200* as a response.

Add default destination rules (we’ll alter this later to affect routing
of requests):

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -f /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/destination-rule-all.yaml
----


List all available destination rules:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc get destinationrules -o yaml
----

Let's move on to the next section and verify our new application.

#### 2. Access Bookinfo

Make sure it’s actually done rolling out. Visit the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo[Topology View, window=_blank] for the catalog, and ensure you get the blue circles!

image::bookinfo_topology.png[Bookinfo App, 700]

Finally, access the http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/productpage[Bookinfo Product Page, window=_blank] and ensure it should look something like:

image::bookinfo.png[Bookinfo App, 700]

Reload the page multiple times. The three different versions of the Reviews service show the star ratings differently - _v1_ shows no stars at all, _v2_ shows black stars, and _v3_ shows red stars:

* *v1* 

image::stars-none.png[no stars]

* *v2* 

image::stars-black.png[black stars]

* *v3*: 

image::stars-red.png[red stars]

That’s because there are 3 versions of reviews deployment for our reviews service. Istio’s load-balancer is using a _round-robin_ algorithm to iterate through the 3 instances of this service.

You should now have your OpenShift Pods running and have an _Envoy sidecar_ in each of them alongside the microservice. The microservices are productpage, details, ratings, and reviews. Note that you’ll have three versions of the reviews microservice:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pods --selector app=reviews
----

The output from the above command should be similar but not the same, since pod names should be different.

[source,sh]
----
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
reviews-v1-7754bbd88-dm4s5    2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v2-69fd995884-qpddl   2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v3-5f9d5bbd8-sz29k    2/2     Running   0          12m
----

Notice that each of the microservices shows *2/2* containers ready for each service (one for the service and one for its sidecar).

Now that we have our application deployed and linked into the Istio service mesh, let’s take a look at the immediate value we can get out of it without touching the application code itself!

##### Congratulations!
