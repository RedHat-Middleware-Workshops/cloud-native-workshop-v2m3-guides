= Creating Distributed Services
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this lab, we’ll install a sample application into the system. This application is included in Istio itself for demonstrating various aspects of it, but the application isn’t tied exclusively to Istio - it’s an ordinary microservice application that could be installed to any OpenShift instance with or without Istio.

The sample application is called _Bookinfo_, a simple application that displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The BookInfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

<1> *productpage* - The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page.
<2> *details* - The `details` microservice contains book information.
<3> *reviews* - The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice to show a ``star'' rating for each
book.
<4> *ratings* - The `ratings` microservice contains book rating
information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

<1> Version `v1` does not call the ratings service.
<2> Version `v2` calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 *black* stars.
<3> Version `v3` calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 *red* stars.

The application architecture is described in the below diagram:

=== 1. Deploy Bookinfo Application

First, open a new browser with the link:{{ CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift web console^]

image::openshift_login.png[openshift_login, 700]

Login using:

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`

You will see a list of projects to which you have access:

image::openshift_landing.png[openshift_landing, 700]

The project displayed on the landing page depends on which labs you will run today. If you will develop `Service Mesh and Identity` then you will see pre-created projects as shown in the above screeenshot.

Although your CodeReady workspace is running on the Kubernetes cluster, it’s running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that prevents you from creating most resource types. If you’ve completed other modules, you’re probably already logged in, but let’s login again: click on *Login to OpenShift*:

[NOTE]
====
When you click on this, CodeReady Workspaces executes the following command:
*oc login https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true --username={{ USER_ID }} --password={{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}*
====

image::cmd-login.png[login,700]

You should see something like this (the project names may be different):

[source,none]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo
    {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
    {{ USER_ID }}-cloudnative-pipeline
    {{ USER_ID }}-cloudnativeapps
    {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
    {{ USER_ID }}-istio-system

Using project "{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.

[NOTE]
====
After you log in using *Login to OpenShift*, the terminal is no longer usable as a regular terminal. You can close the terminal window. You will still be logged in when you open more terminals later!

#####  ServiceMeshMemberRoll
Before we start depoying our application we need to make sure we have the right access to our different application namespaces. The _ServiceMeshControlPlane_ that includes _Elasticsearch_, _Jaeger_, _Kiali_ and _Service Mesh Operators_, have all been installed at the cluster provisioning time. However for applications to communicate to each other accross different namespaces, we need to ensure that the _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_ is also created.

Let's create the _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_

- Login to the openshift console link:{{CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift web console^]
- Press the plus sign on the right top corner as shown in the picture.

image::plus-icon.png[Run yaml in console, 700]

- Select your namespace `{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system` on the top left; as shown in the picture and paste the below _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_ YAML code into the editor.

[source, yaml, role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-istio-system <1>
spec:
  members:
    - {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo <2>
    - {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
    - {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----
<1> is the istio-system namespace which will hold the _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_ and a bunch of other service mesh related objects.
<2> is the list of projects that will be part of this _ServiceMesh_; in our case that's the application spread in three different namespaces/projects.

Click **Create**. This should create the required _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_.

Congratulations! Now we have successfully created a _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_ which will cause a new service mesh to be deployed into the `{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system` project. let's move on to deploy our application to our service mesh.

#####  Deploying BookInfo App

Open a terminal via CodeReady Workspaces and run the following commands to deploy the bookinfo app:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/bookinfo.yaml
----

And then create the _ingress gateway_ for the bookinfo:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
----

The above default ingress manages traffic for any incoming host, but we only want it to manage traffic destined to our own ingress, so change the host from `*` to your specific host with this command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc patch -n {{USER_ID}}-bookinfo virtualservice/bookinfo --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/hosts","value": ["istio-ingressgateway-{{USER_ID}}-istio-system.{{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}"]}]'
----

Finally, add default destination rules (we’ll alter this later to affect routing of requests):

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/destination-rule-all.yaml
----

List all available destination rules:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc get -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo destinationrules
----

When the app is installed, each Pod will get an additional _sidecar_ container as described earlier.

Add some nice labels to correspond to the different langages/frameworks used in the app:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{USER_ID}}-bookinfo && \
oc label deployment/productpage-v1 app.openshift.io/runtime=python --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/details-v1 app.openshift.io/runtime=ruby --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/reviews-v1 app.openshift.io/runtime=java --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/reviews-v2 app.openshift.io/runtime=java --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/reviews-v3 app.openshift.io/runtime=java --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/ratings-v1 app.openshift.io/runtime=nodejs --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/details-v1 app.kubernetes.io/part-of=bookinfo --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/productpage-v1 app.kubernetes.io/part-of=bookinfo --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/ratings-v1 app.kubernetes.io/part-of=bookinfo --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/reviews-v1 app.kubernetes.io/part-of=bookinfo --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/reviews-v2 app.kubernetes.io/part-of=bookinfo --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/reviews-v3 app.kubernetes.io/part-of=bookinfo --overwrite && \
oc annotate deployment/productpage-v1 app.openshift.io/connects-to=reviews-v1,reviews-v2,reviews-v3,details-v1 && \
oc annotate deployment/reviews-v2 app.openshift.io/connects-to=ratings-v1 && \
oc annotate deployment/reviews-v3 app.openshift.io/connects-to=ratings-v1
----

Let’s wait for our application to finish deploying. Go to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo[Topology View^] for the `{{USER_ID}}-bookinfo` project. You'll see the app components spinning up:

image::bookinfo_topology.png[Bookinfo App, 700]

Wait for each component to have the full blue circles,
or you can execute the following commands to wait for the deployment to complete and result `successfully rolled out`:

[source,shell,role="copypaste"]
----
 oc rollout status -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -w deployment/productpage-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -w deployment/reviews-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -w deployment/reviews-v2 && \
 oc rollout status -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -w deployment/reviews-v3 && \
 oc rollout status -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -w deployment/details-v1 && \
 oc rollout status -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -w deployment/ratings-v1
----

Finally, access the http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/productpage[Bookinfo Product Page^]. It should look something like:

image::bookinfo.png[Bookinfo App, 700]

Reload the page multiple times. The three different versions of the Reviews service show the star ratings differently - _v1_ shows no stars at all, _v2_ shows black stars, and _v3_ shows red stars:

* *v1*

image::stars-none.png[no stars, 700, 700]

* *v2*

image::stars-black.png[black stars, 700]

* *v3*:

image::stars-red.png[red stars, 700]

That’s because there are 3 versions of reviews deployment for our reviews service. Istio’s load-balancer is using a _round-robin_ algorithm to iterate through the 3 instances of this service.

You should now have your OpenShift Pods running and have an _Envoy sidecar_ in each of them alongside the microservice. The microservices are productpage, details, ratings, and reviews. Note that you’ll have three versions of the reviews microservice:

[source,shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pods -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo --selector app=reviews
----

The output from the above command should be similar but not the same, since pod names should be different.

[source,sh]
----
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
reviews-v1-7754bbd88-dm4s5    2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v2-69fd995884-qpddl   2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v3-5f9d5bbd8-sz29k    2/2     Running   0          12m
----

Notice that each of the microservices shows *2/2* containers ready for each service (one for the service and one for its sidecar).

Now that we have our application deployed and linked into the Istio service mesh, let’s take a look at the immediate value we can get out of it without touching the application code itself!

*Congratulations!* You now successfully deployed your first application within your OpenShift Service Mesh. Lets move to the next lab _Service Visulization and Montioring_
