= Service Mesh and Identity
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this module, you will learn how to prevent cascading failures in a distributed environment, how to detect misbehaving services, and how to avoid having to implement resiliency and monitoring in your business logic. As we transition our applications towards a distributed architecture with microservices deployed across a distributed
network, many new challenges await us.

Technologies like containers and container orchestration platforms like OpenShift solve the deployment of our distributed applications quite well, but some challenges remain with distributed apps:

* Unpredictable failure modes
* Verifying end-to-end application correctness
* Unexpected system degradation
* Continuous topology changes
* The use of elastic/ephemeral/transient resources

Today, developers are responsible for taking into account these challenges, and do things like:

* Circuit breaking and Bulkheading (e.g. with Netfix Hystrix)
* Timeouts/retries
* Service discovery (e.g. with Eureka)
* Client-side load balancing (e.g. with Netfix Ribbon)

Another challenge is each runtime and language addresses these with different libraries and frameworks, and in some cases there may be no implementation of a particular library for your chosen language or runtime.

In this section we'll explore how to use the OpenShift _Service Mesh_. Service Mesh is based on the _Istio_ open source project. It enables a much more robust, reliable, and resilient application in the face of the new world of dynamic distributed applications.

=== What is Istio?

image::istio-logo.png[Logo, 600, align="center"]

http://istio.io[Istio^] forms the basis for the OpenShift Service Mesh and is an open, platform-independent service mesh designed to manage communications between microservices and applications in a transparent way. It provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole. It provides a number of key capabilities uniformly across a network of services:

* *Traffic Management* - Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
* *Observability* - Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.
* *Policy Enforcement* - Apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
* *Service Identity and Security* - Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustability.

These capabilities greatly decrease the coupling between application code, the underlying platform, and policy. This decreased coupling not only makes services easier to implement, but also makes it simpler for operators to move application deployments between environments or to new policy schemes. Applications become inherently more portable as a result.

Sounds fun, right? Let’s get started!

=== Getting Ready for the labs

If you've already worked on prior labs today, you'll be familiar with the CodeReady Workspaces environment and can skip down to the *Import Project* section below.

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipe Che^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ ECLIPSE_CHE_URL }}[access the CodeReady Workspaces instance^] and log in using the username and password you’ve been assigned (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

image::che-login.png[cdw, 700]

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the name of
the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number).

image::crw-landing.png[cdw, 700]

You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green {{ USER_ID}}-namespace that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen:

image::crw-landing-start.png[cdw, 700]

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:

image::che-workspace.png[cdw, 900]

This IDE is based on Eclipse Che (which is in turn based on MicroSoft VS Code editor).

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

==== Import project

Let's import our first project. Click on **Git Clone..** (or type kbd:[F1], enter 'git' and click on the auto-completed _Git Clone.._ )

image::che-workspace-gitclone.png[cdw, 600, align="center"]

Step through the prompts, using the following value for **Repository URL**. If you use *FireFox*, it may end up pasting extra spaces at the end, so just press backspace after pasting:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----

https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs.git

----

image::crw-clone-repo.png[crw, 600, align="center"]

Click on *Select Repository Location* then click on *Open in New Window*. It will open a new web browser immediately:

image::crw-add-workspace.png[crw, 900]

The project is imported into your workspace and is visible in the project explorer after clicking the *Explorer* pane at the upper right:

image::crw-clone-explorer.png[crw, 600, align="center"]

==== IMPORTANT: Check out proper Git branch

To make sure you're using the right version of the project files, run this command in a CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs && git checkout ocp-4.7
----

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:

=== Remove other projects

If you've completed other modules today (such as `cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs`), remove them from your workspace by right-clicking on the project name in the explorer and choose *Delete* and accept the warning. Be sure not to delete the new project you just imported for this lab!
