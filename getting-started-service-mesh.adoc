= Service Mesh and Identity
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this module, you will learn how to prevent cascading failures in a distributed environment, how to detect misbehaving services, and how to avoid having to implement resiliency and monitoring in your business logic. As we transition our applications towards a distributed architecture with microservices deployed across a distributed
network, many new challenges await us.

Technologies like containers and container orchestration platforms like OpenShift solve the deployment of our distributed applications quite well, but some challenges remain with distributed apps:

* Unpredictable failure modes
* Verifying end-to-end application correctness
* Unexpected system degradation
* Continuous topology changes
* The use of elastic/ephemeral/transient resources

Today, developers are responsible for taking into account these challenges, and do things like:

* Circuit breaking and Bulkheading (e.g. with Netfix Hystrix)
* Timeouts/retries
* Service discovery (e.g. with Eureka)
* Client-side load balancing (e.g. with Netfix Ribbon)

Another challenge is each runtime and language addresses these with different libraries and frameworks, and in some cases there may be no implementation of a particular library for your chosen language or runtime.

In this section we'll explore how to use the OpenShift _Service Mesh_. Service Mesh is based on the _Istio_ open source project. It enables a much more robust, reliable, and resilient application in the face of the new world of dynamic distributed applications.

=== What is Istio?

image::istio-logo.png[Logo, 600, align="center"]

http://istio.io[Istio^] forms the basis for the OpenShift Service Mesh and is an open, platform-independent service mesh designed to manage communications between microservices and applications in a transparent way. It provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole. It provides a number of key capabilities uniformly across a network of services:

* *Traffic Management* - Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
* *Observability* - Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.
* *Policy Enforcement* - Apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
* *Service Identity and Security* - Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustability.

These capabilities greatly decrease the coupling between application code, the underlying platform, and policy. This decreased coupling not only makes services easier to implement, but also makes it simpler for operators to move application deployments between environments or to new policy schemes. Applications become inherently more portable as a result.

Sounds fun, right? Let’s get started!

=== Getting Ready for the labs

You will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^]. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ DS_URL }}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ DS_USER_PASSWORD }}`

====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

In case you've already created a workspace (*ccn-workshop*) for another module, make sure to delete it first.

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

* *Git Repo URL*: `https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/tree/ocp-4.14`

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace quarkus-workshop*. It takes about *60* seconds to finish the process.

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this information page, select `Start your workspace` to continue  using your workspace.

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**
