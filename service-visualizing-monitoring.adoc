= Lab 2 - Service Visualization and Monitoring
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this lab you will visualize your service mesh using *Kiali*, *Prometheus*, *Grafana* and you will lean how to configure basic *Istio functionalities* such as *VirtualService* and *A/B Testing*.

=== 1. Generating application load

To get a better idea of the power of metrics, let’s setup an endless loop that will continually access the application and generate load for about 30 minutes. We’ll open up a separate terminal just for this purpose.

Open a new _CodeReady Workspaces Terminal_ and run the following command:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
BOOK_URL=istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}

for i in {1..1000} ; do curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://$BOOK_URL/productpage ; sleep 2 ; done
----

This command will endlessly access the application and report the HTTP status result in a separate terminal window. The script should return an endless `200`.

With this application load running, metrics will become much more interesting in the next few steps.

=== 2. Examine Kiali

*Kiali* allows you to manage and monitor your mesh from a single UI. This UI will allow you to view configurations, monitor traffic flow and
health, and analyze traces.

Open the https://kiali-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[Kiali console^].

You should see _OpenShift Login_ screen. Enter the username and password as below and click _Log In_.

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`

You will see _Overvew_ page in Kiali like this:

image::kiali-all-namespaces.png[kiali, 700]

==== Service Graph

Click on the _Graph_ page on the left and check *Traffic Animation* in *Display*. You'll also need to select the `{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo` project in the _Namespace_ dropdown at the top:

image::kiali-service-graph.png[kiali, 700]

It shows a graph with all the microservices, connected by the requests going through them. On this page, you can see how services interact with each other. Observe that traffic from _productpage_ to _reviews_ is equally hitting all three versions of the reviews service, and that _v2_ and _v3_ are in turn hitting the _ratings_ service (while _v1_ does not, so therefore you get no _stars_ when you get load-balanced to _v1_).

==== Applications

Click on *Applications* menu in the left navigation. On this page you can view a listing of all the services that are running in the cluster, and additional information about them, such as health status.

image::kiali-applications.png[kiali, 700]

Click on the *productpage* application to see its details. You can also see the health of a service on the *Health* section when it’s online and responding to requests without errors:

image::kiali-app-productpage.png[kiali, 700]

By clicking on *Inbound Metrics*, you can see the metrics for an application, like this:

image::kiali-app-productpage-inbound.png[kiali, 700]

By clicking on *Outbound Metrics*, you can see the metrics for an application, like this:

image::kiali-app-productpage-outbound.png[kiali, 700]

==== Workloads

Click on the *Workloads* menu in the left navigation. On this page you can view a listing of all the workloads that are present in your application.

image::kiali-app-productpage-workload.png[kiali, 700]

Click on the *productpage-v1* workload. Here you can see details for the workload, such as the pods and services that are included in it:

image::kiali-app-productpage-workload-v1.png[kiali, 700]

By clicking _Inbound Metrics_, you can check the metrics for the workload. The metrics are the same as the _Application_ ones.

==== Services

Click on *Services* menu in the left navigation. Here, you can see the listing of all services.

image::kiali-services.png[kiali, 700]

Click on *productpage* service which will show you the details of the service, such as metrics, traces, workloads, virtual services, destination rules and more:

image::kiali-services-productpage.png[kiali, 700]

==== Distributed Tracing

Kiali also features integration with https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger^].  This lets you follow the path of a request through various microservices that make up an application (without having to update the app itself!).

To view the traces being generated, click on the **Distributed Tracing** link on the left:

image::kiali-tracing.png[kiali, 700]

This will open the https://jaeger-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[Jaeger Query console^].

You should see the _OpenShift Login_ screen. Enter the username and password as below and click _Log In_.

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`

If you have Requested permissions to authorize access Jaeger, click on Allow selected permissions. You will land on the Jaeger query page:

image::kiali-tracing-jaeger.png[kiali, 700]

* **Service**: `productpage.{{USER_ID}}-bookinfo`
* **Operation**: `all`

Then click **Find Traces**. This will show you recent traces:

image::kiali-tracing-traces.png[kiali, 700]

Click on one of them, as shown above to get detailed trace and span data:

image::kiali-tracing-traces-trace.png[kiali, 700]

This trace consists of a few nested spans, each corresponding to a Bookinfo Service call, all performed in response to a `/productpage request.

Overall processing time was 23.23ms, with the details Service taking 2.04ms, the reviews Service taking 7.17ms, and the ratings Service taking 0.72ms. Each of the calls to remote Services is represented by a client-side and server-side span.

You can use this information (and even compare two different traces) to spot problems with applications quickly.

=== 3. Querying Metrics with Prometheus

https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] will periodically _scrape_ applications to retrieve their metrics (by default on the `/metrics` endpoint of the application). The Prometheus add-on for Istio is a Prometheus server that comes pre-configured to _scrape_ Istio Mixer endpoints to collect its exposed metrics. It provides a mechanism for persistent storage and querying of those metrics metrics.

Open the https://prometheus-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[Prometheus console^] and click on *Log in with OpenShift*.

You should see _OpenShift Login_ screen. Enter the username and password as below and click _Log In_. If you have _Requested permissions_ to authorize access Prometheus, click on *Allow selected permissions*. Then, you will see Prometheus home screen, similar to this:

[NOTE]
====
You might see this "Warning! Detected 54.68 seconds time difference between your browser and the server. Prometheus relies on accurate time and time drift might cause unexpected query results". Then, you can ignore it.
====

image::istio-prometheus-landing.png[istio-prometheus, 700]

In the `Expression` input box at the top of the web page, enter the following text. Then, click the *Execute* button.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
istio_request_duration_milliseconds_count
----

You should see a listing of each of the application’s services along with a count of how many times it was accessed.

image::istio-prometheus-console.png[Prometheus console, 700]

You can also graph the results over time by clicking on the _Graph_ tab (adjust the timeframe from 1 hour to 1 minute for example):

image::istio-prometheus-graph.png[Prometheus graph, 700]

Other expressions to try:

* Total count of all requests to _productpage_ service:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
istio_request_duration_milliseconds_count{destination_service=~"productpage.*"}
----

* Total count of all requests to _v3_ of the _reviews_ service:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
istio_request_duration_milliseconds_count{destination_service=~"reviews.*", destination_version="v3"}
----

* Rate of requests over the past 5 minutes to all _productpage_ services:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
rate(istio_request_duration_milliseconds_count{destination_service=~"productpage.*", response_code="200"}[5m])
----

There are many, many different queries you can perform to extract the data you need. Consult the https://prometheus.io/docs[Prometheus documentation] for more detail.

=== 4. Visualizing Metrics with Grafana

As the number of services and interactions grows in your application, this style of metrics may be a bit overwhelming. https://grafana.com/[Grafana^] provides a visual representation of many available Prometheus metrics extracted from the Istio data plane and can be used to quickly spot problems and take action.

Open the https://grafana-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[Grafana console^]

You should see _OpenShift Login_ screen. Enter the username and password as below and click _Log In_. If you have _Requested permissions_ to authorize access Prometheus, click on *Allow selected permissions*. Then, you will see Prometheus home screen, similar to this:

image::grafana-home.png[Grafana graph, 700]

==== Istio Mesh Metrics

Select *Dashboard Icon > Manage > Istio > Istio Mesh Dashboard* to see Istio mesh metrics:

image::grafana-mesh-metrics-select.png[Grafana graph, 700]

You will see the built-in Istio metrics dashboard:

image::grafana-mesh-metrics.png[Grafana graph, 700]

==== Istio Service Metrics

Let’s see detailed metrics of the *productpage* service. Click on *productpage.{{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo.svc.cluster.local* and the service dashboard will look similar to this:

image::grafana-service-metrics.png[Grafana graph, 700]

The Grafana Dashboard for Istio consists of three main sections:

* _A Global Summary View_ provides a high-level summary of HTTP requests flowing through the service mesh.
* _A Mesh Summary View_ provides slightly more detail than the Global Summary View, allowing per-service filtering and selection.
* _Individual Services View_ provides metrics about requests and responses for each individual service within the mesh (HTTP and TCP).

[NOTE]
====
_TCP Bandwidth_ metrics are empty, as Bookinfo uses http-based services only. Lower down on this dashboard are metrics for workloads that call this service (labeled ``Client Workloads'') and for workloads that process requests from the service (labeled _Service Workloads_).
====

You can switch to a different service or filter metrics by _client-_ and _service-workloads_ by using drop-down lists at the top of the dashboard.

==== Istio Workload Metrics

To switch to the workloads dashboard, select *Dashboard Icon > Manage > Istio > Istio Workload Dashboard* from the drop-down list in the top left corner of the screen. You should see a screen similar to this:

image::grafana-workload-metrics.png[Grafana graph, 700]

This dashboard shows workload’s metrics, and metrics for client-(inbound) and service (outbound) workloads. You can switch to a different workload, ot filter metrics by inbound or outbound workloads by using drop-down lists at the top of the dashboard.

For more on how to create, configure, and edit dashboards, please see the http://docs.grafana.org/[Grafana documentation^].

As a developer, you can get quite a bit of information from these metrics without doing anything to the application itself. Let’s use our new tools in the next section to see the real power of Istio to diagnose and fix issues in applications and make them more resilient and robust.

=== 5. Request Routing

This task shows you how to configure dynamic request routing based on weights and HTTP headers.

_Route rules_ control how requests are routed within an Istio service mesh. Route rules provide:

* **Timeouts** to minimize wait times for slow services
* **Bounded retries** with timeout budgets and variable jitter between retries
* **Limits** on number of concurrent connections and requests to upstream services
* **Active (periodic) health checks** on each member of the load balancing pool
* **Fine-grained circuit breakers** (passive health checks) – applied per instance in the load balancing pool

Requests can be routed based on the source and destination, HTTP header fields, and weights associated with individual service versions. For example, a route rule could route requests to different versions of a service.

Together, these features enable the service mesh to tolerate failing nodes and prevent localized failures from cascading instability to other nodes. However, applications must still be designed to deal with failures by taking appropriate fallback actions. For example, when all instances in a load balancing pool have failed, Istio will return HTTP 503. It is the responsibility of the application to implement any fallback logic that is needed to handle the HTTP 503 error code from an upstream service.

If your application already provides some defensive measures (e.g. using https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Netflix Hystrix^]), then that’s OK. *Istio* is completely transparent to the application. A failure response returned by Istio would not be distinguishable from a failure response returned by the upstream service to which the call was made.

=== 6. Service Versions

Istio introduces the concept of a service version, which is a finer-grained way to subdivide service instances by versions (_v1_, _v2_) or environment (_staging_, _prod_). These variants are not necessarily different API versions: they could be iterative changes to the same service, deployed in different environments (prod, staging, dev, etc.). Common scenarios where this is used include A/B testing or canary rollouts. Istio’s https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#routing-rules[traffic routing rules^] can refer to service versions to provide additional control over traffic between services.

image::versions.png[Versions, 500]

As illustrated in the figure above, clients of a service have no knowledge of different versions of the service. They can continue to access the services using the hostname/IP address of the service. The Envoy sidecar/proxy intercepts and forwards all requests/responses between the client and the service.

=== 7. VirtualService objects

In addition to the usual OpenShift object types like _BuildConfig_, _DeploymentConfig_, _Service_ and _Route_, you also have new object types installed as part of Istio like _VirtualService_. Adding these objects to the running OpenShift cluster is how you configure routing rules for Istio.

For our application, without an explicit default route set, Istio will route requests to all available versions of a service in a round-robin fashion, and anytime you hit _v1_ version you’ll get no stars.

Let’s create a default set of *virtual services* which will direct all traffic to the _reviews:v1_ service version.

Open a new Terminal (while your other endless `for` loop continues to run) and execute this command to route all traffic to `v1`:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
----

You can see this default set of _virtual services_ with:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc get virtualservices -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -o yaml
----

There are default _virtual services_ for each service, such as the one that forces all traffic to the _v1_ version of the _reviews_ service:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc get virtualservices/reviews -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -o yaml
----

The output can be a bit different:
 
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2021-03-02T21:41:57Z"
  generation: 1
  managedFields:
  - apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    fieldsType: FieldsV1
    fieldsV1:
      f:spec:
        .: {}
        f:hosts: {}
        f:http: {}
    manager: kubectl-create
    operation: Update
    time: "2021-03-02T21:41:57Z"
  name: reviews
  namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-bookinfo
  resourceVersion: "4848293"
  selfLink: /apis/networking.istio.io/v1beta1/namespaces/user2-bookinfo/virtualservices/reviews
  uid: 75996b09-1a5c-41ab-a5aa-35861d6b8fa2
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
----

Now, access the application again in your web browser using the below link and reload the page several times - you should not see any rating stars since *reviews:v1* does not access the _ratings_ service.

[NOTE]
====
It may take a minute or two for the new routing to take effect. If you still see red or black stars, wait a minute and try again.
Eventually it should no longer show any red/black stars.
====

To verify this, access the http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/productpage[Bookinfo Product Page^] and ensure you have no rating stars:

image::ratings-stopped-bookinfo.png[Versions, 700]

Back on the https://grafana-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[Grafana console^], Select the *Istio Service Dashboard*, and then select the `ratings.{{USER_ID}}-bookinfo.svc.cluster.local` service in the _Service_ dropdown:

image::ratings-select-dash.png[Versions, 700]

Notice that the requests coming from the reviews service have stopped:

image::ratings-stopped.png[Versions, 700]

=== 8. A/B Testing with Istio

Let’s enable the ratings service for a test user named _jason_ by routing `productpage` traffic to _reviews:v2_ (black stars) and any others to _reviews:v3_ (red stars). Execute:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/virtual-service-reviews-jason-v2-v3.yaml
----

[TIP]
====
You can ignore warnings like _Warning: oc apply should be used on resource created by either oc create –save-config or oc apply_.
====


Confirm the rule is created:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
oc get virtualservices/reviews -n {{ USER_ID}}-bookinfo -o yaml
----

Notice the _match_ element:

[source,yaml]
----
http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3
----

This says that for any incoming HTTP request that has a cookie set to the _jason_ user to direct traffic to *reviews:v2*, and others to *reviews:v3*.

Now, access the http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/productpage[Bookinfo Product Page^] and click *Sign In* (at the upper right) and sign in with:

* Username: *jason*
* Password: *jason*

[NOTE]
====
If you get any certificate security exceptions, just accept them and continue. This is due to the use of self-signed certs.
====

Once you login, refresh a few times - you should always see the black ratings stars coming from *ratings:v2* since you’re signed in as `jason`.

image::ratings-testuser.png[Ratings for Test User, 700]

If you *sign out*, you’ll return to the *reviews:v3* version which shows red ratings stars.

image::ratings-signout.png[Ratings for Test User, 700]

*Congratulations!* In this lab, you used Istio to send 100% of the traffic to the a specific version of one of the application’s services. You then set a
rule to selectively send traffic to other versions of based on matching criteria (e.g. a header or user cookie) in a request.

This routing allows you to selectively send traffic to different service instances, e.g. for testing, or blue/green deployments, or dark launches, and more.

We’ll explore this in the next step.
