= Lab 3 - Advanced Service Mesh Development
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this lab, we will learn the advanced use cases of service mesh. The lab showcases features:

* Fault Injection
* Traffic Shifting
* Circuit Breaking
* Rate Limiting

These features are important for any distributed applications built on top of Kubernetes/Openshift. We use a different set of microservices that you will be building and deploying. Our applicaiton is called the _Coolstore microservice_ developed in prior labs (i.e Catalog, Inventory) that you developed and deployed to
OpenShift cluster in _Module 1_ or/and _Module 2_.

[WARNING]
====
If you have already deployed the _inventory_ and _catalog_ microservices from Module 1, you can skip this step and move to section "1. Enabling automatic sidecar injection"
====

**In case you haven’t done Module 1 or Module 2 today**, or you didn’t quite complete them, you should deploy the coolstore application and microservices by executing the following shell scripts in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

The following script will deploy the inventory service:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
sh $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/scripts/deploy-inventory.sh {{ USER_ID }}  && \
sh $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/scripts/deploy-catalog.sh {{ USER_ID }}
----

[WARNING]
====
It sometimes takes time to create a new build image for network latency in OpenShift. So if you got failed to deploy catalog-service with *Error from server (NotFound): services "catalog-springboot" not found*. Please try again with delay via the following command:
====

[source, sh, role="copypaste"]
----
sh $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/scripts/deploy-inventory.sh {{ USER_ID }}  && \
sh $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/istio/scripts/deploy-catalog.sh {{ USER_ID }} 3m
----

Wait for the commands to complete. This will build and deploy the _inventory_ and _catalog_ components into their own namespaces. They won’t automatically get Istio sidecar proxy containers yet, but you’ll add that in the next step!

=== 1. Enabling automatic sidecar injection

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh relies on a proxy sidecar within the application’s pod to provide Service Mesh capabilities to the application. You can enable automatic sidecar injection or manage it manually. Red Hat recommends automatic injection using the annotation with no need to label projects. This ensures that your application contains the appropriate configuration for the Service Mesh upon deployment. This method requires fewer privileges and does not conflict with other OpenShift capabilities such as builder pods.

[NOTE]
====
The upstream version of Istio injects the sidecar by default if you have labeled the project. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh requires you to opt in to having the sidecar automatically injected to a deployment, so you are not required to label the project. This avoids injecting a sidecar if it is not wanted (for example, in build or deploy pods).

The webhook checks the configuration of pods deploying into all projects to see if they are opting in to injection with the appropriate annotation.
====

==== Confirm `inventory` and `catalog` services are running

First, confirm you have running catalog service and associated database with the following command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pods -n {{USER_ID}}-catalog --field-selector status.phase=Running
----

You should see two pods running (one for the service, and one for its database):

[source,console]
----
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
catalog-database-1-p5hcd     1/1     Running   0          6m4s
catalog-springboot-1-jdrfs   1/1     Running   0          5m
----

Do the same for inventory:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pods -n {{USER_ID}}-inventory --field-selector status.phase=Running
----

You should again see two pods running (one for the service, and one for its database):

[source,console]
----
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-1-87smf            1/1     Running   0          3m12s
inventory-database-1-6tvxs   1/1     Running   0          5m16s
----

==== Add sidecars

OpenShift Service Mesh requires that applications "opt-in" to being part of a service mesh by default. To "opt-in" an app, you need to add an annotation which is a flag to istio to attach a sidecar and bring the app into the mesh.

Rather than manually adding the annotations necessary to inject istio sidecars, run the following commands to add the annotations which will trigger a sidecar to be injected into our _inventory_ and _catalog_ microservices, as well as their associated databases.

First, do the databases and wait for them to be re-deployed:
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc patch dc/inventory-database -n {{USER_ID}}-inventory --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc patch dc/catalog-database -n {{USER_ID}}-catalog --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc rollout status -w dc/inventory-database -n {{USER_ID}}-inventory && \
oc rollout status -w dc/catalog-database -n {{USER_ID}}-catalog
----

This should take about 1 minute to finish.

[NOTE]
====
The above complex-looking command uses the `oc patch` command to programmatically edit the Kubernetes objects. You could just as easily have edited the file in an editor, but YAML can sometimes be tricky so we made it easy for you!
====

Next, let's add sidecars to our services and wait for them to be re-deployed:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc patch dc/inventory -n {{USER_ID}}-inventory --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc rollout latest dc/inventory -n {{USER_ID}}-inventory && \
oc patch dc/catalog-springboot -n {{USER_ID}}-catalog --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc rollout status -w dc/inventory -n {{USER_ID}}-inventory && \
oc rollout status -w dc/catalog-springboot -n {{USER_ID}}-catalog
----

This should also take about 1 minute to finish. When it's done, verify that the `inventory-database` is running with 2 pods (`2/2` in the `READY` column) with this command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pods -n {{USER_ID}}-inventory --field-selector="status.phase=Running"
----

It should show:

[source,console,role="copypaste"]
----
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-2-2p9bx            2/2     Running   0          65s
inventory-database-2-4rzlh   2/2     Running   0          82s
----

Do the same for the catalog and confirm they also show the "2/2" pods running:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pods -n {{USER_ID}}-catalog --field-selector="status.phase=Running"
----

[source,console,role="copypaste"]
----
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
catalog-database-2-djmbd     2/2     Running   0          39m
catalog-springboot-2-x7cf6   2/2     Running   0          39m
----

[WARNING]
====
It may take a minute or two before the `inventory` and `catalog` services are recognized and brought into the mesh.
====

Next, let's create a virtual service to send incoming traffic to the catalog. Open the empty `catalog-default.yaml` file in _catalog/rules_ directory to copy the following _VirtualService_ into the empty file using CodeReady Workspaces:

[source,yaml, role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: catalog-default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}"
  gateways:
  - {{USER_ID}}-bookinfo/bookinfo-gateway
  http:
    - match:
        - uri:
            exact: /services/products
        - uri:
            exact: /services/product
        - uri:
            exact: /
      route:
        - destination:
            host: catalog-springboot
            port:
              number: 8080
----

Execute the following command in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/catalog/rules/catalog-default.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
----

Access the http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[Catalog Service Page^] and ensure it should look something like:

image::catalog-ui-gateway.png[catalog, 700]

[NOTE]
====
It takes a few seconds to reconcile _istio ingress_ with the _gateway_ and _virtual service_. Leave this page open as the _Catalog UI browser_ creates traffic (every 2 seconds) between services, which is useful for testing.
====

Ensure if we injected _side car_ to each pods. Access the https://kiali-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/console/graph/namespaces/?edges=noEdgeLabels&graphType=versionedApp&namespaces={{ USER_ID }}-catalog%2C{{ USER_ID }}-inventory&unusedNodes=false&injectServiceNodes=true&duration=60&pi=15000&layout=dagre[Kiali Graph page^] and verify that *{{ USER_ID }}-inventory*, *{{ USER_ID }}-catalog* are selected _Namespaces_ then enable *Traffic Animation* in the _Display_ drop-down to see animated traffic flow from _Catalog service_ to _Inventory service_:

image::kiali_graph_sidecar.png[istio, 700]

You can see the incoming traffic to the catalog service along with traffic going to both the catalog and inventory databases along each branch. This mirrors what we would expect - when you access the catalog frontend, a call is made to the catalog backend, which in turn access the inventory and combines it with catalog data and returns the result for display.

[NOTE]
====
You may occasionally see _unknown_ or _PassthroughCluster_ elements in the graph. These are due to the istio configuration changes we are doing in realtime and would disappear if you wait long enough, but you can ignore them for this lab.
====

=== 2. Fault Injection

This step will walk you through how to use *Fault Injection* to test the end-to-end failure recovery capability of the application as a whole. An incorrect configuration of the failure recovery policies could result in unavailability of critical services. Examples of incorrect configurations include incompatible or restrictive timeouts across service calls.

_Istio_ provides a set of failure recovery features that can be taken advantage of by the services in an application. Features include:

* **Timeouts** to minimize wait times for slow services
* **Bounded retries** with timeout budgets and variable jitter between retries
* **Limits** on number of concurrent connections and requests to upstream services
* **Active (periodic) health checks** on each member of the load balancing pool
* **Fine-grained circuit breakers** (passive health checks) – applied per instance in the load balancing pool

These features can be dynamically configured at runtime through Istio’s traffic management rules.

A combination of active and passive health checks minimizes the chances of accessing an unhealthy service. When combined with platform-level health checks (such as readiness/liveness probes in OpenShift), applications can ensure that unhealthy pods/containers/VMs can be quickly weeded out of the service mesh, minimizing the request failures and impact on latency.

Together, these features enable the service mesh to tolerate failing nodes and prevent localized failures from cascading instability to other nodes.

Istio enables protocol-specific _fault injection_ into the network (instead of killing pods) by delaying or corrupting packets at TCP layer.

Two types of faults can be injected:

* _Delays_ are timing failures. They mimic increased network latency or an overloaded upstream service.
* _Aborts_ are crash failures. They mimic failures in upstream services. Aborts usually manifest in the form of HTTP error codes or TCP connection failures.

To test our application microservices for resiliency, we will inject a failure in *50%* of the requests to the _inventory_ service, causing the service to appear to fail (and return `HTTP 5xx` errors) half of the time.

Open the empty `inventory-default.yaml` file in the _inventory/rules_ directory and copy the following into the file:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: inventory-default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}"
  gateways:
  - {{USER_ID}}-bookinfo/bookinfo-gateway
  http:
    - match:
        - uri:
            exact: /services/inventory
        - uri:
            exact: /
      route:
        - destination:
            host: inventory
            port:
              number: 8080
----

Delete the gateway to direct route catalog that was setup earlier with:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/catalog/rules/catalog-default.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
----

Create the new VirtualService to direct traffic to the inventory service by running the following command via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/inventory/rules/inventory-default.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

Now, you can test if the inventory service works correctly via accessing the http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[CoolStore Inventory page^]. If you still see _Coolstore Catalog_ then reload the page to see _Coolstore Inventory_ with kbd:[CTRL+F5] (or kbd:[Command+Shift+R] on Mac OS).

image::inventory-ui-gateway.png[fault-injection, 700]

Let’s inject a failure (_500 status_) in *50%* of requests to _inventory_ microservices. Edit _inventory-default.yaml_ as below.

Open the empty `inventory-vs-fault.yaml` file in _inventory/rules_ directory and copy the following codes.

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: inventory-fault
spec:
  hosts:
  - "istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}"
  gateways:
  - {{USER_ID}}-bookinfo/bookinfo-gateway
  http:
    - fault:
         abort:
           httpStatus: 500
           percentage:
             value: 50
      route:
        - destination:
            host: inventory
            port:
              number: 8080
----

Before creating a new *inventory-fault VirtualService*, we need to delete the existing inventory-default virtualService. Run the following command via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete virtualservice/inventory-default -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

Then create a new VirtualService with this command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/inventory/rules/inventory-vs-fault.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

Let’s find out if the fault injection works corectly via accessing the http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[CoolStore Inventory page^] once again. You will see that the *Status* of CoolStore Inventory continues to change between *DEAD* and *OK*:

image::inventory-dead-ok.png[fault-injection, 700]

Back on the https://kiali-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/console/graph/namespaces/?edges=noEdgeLabels&graphType=versionedApp&namespaces={{ USER_ID }}-catalog%2C{{ USER_ID }}-inventory&unusedNodes=false&injectServiceNodes=true&duration=60&pi=15000&layout=dagre[Kiali Graph page^] and you will see `red` traffic from _istio-ingressgateway_ as well as around 50% of requests are displayed as _5xx_ on the right side, _HTTP Traffic_. It may not be _exactly_ 50% since some traffic is coming from the catalog and ingress gateway at the same time, but it will approach 50% over time.

[WARNING]
====
Kiali "looks back" and records/displays the last minute of traffic, so if you're quick you may see some of the prior traffic flows from earlier in the lab. Within 1 minute the graph should clear up and only show what you are looking for!
====

image::inventlry-vs-error-kiali.png[fault-injection,700]

Let’s now add a 5 second delay for the `inventory` service.

Open the empty `inventory-vs-fault-delay.yaml` file in _inventory/rules_ directory and copy the following code into it:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: inventory-fault-delay
spec:
  hosts:
  - "istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}"
  gateways:
  - {{USER_ID}}-bookinfo/bookinfo-gateway
  http:
    - fault:
         delay:
           fixedDelay: 5s
           percentage:
             value: 100
      route:
        - destination:
            host: inventory
            port:
              number: 8080
----

Delete the existing inventory-fault VirtualService in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete virtualservice/inventory-fault -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

Then create a new virtualservice:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/inventory/rules/inventory-vs-fault-delay.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

Go to the *Kiali Graph* you opened earlier and you will see that the `green` traffic from _istio-ingressgateway_ is delayed for requests coming from inventory service. Note that you need to check *Traffic Animation* in the _Display_ select box.

[NOTE]
====
You may still see "red" traffic from our previous fault injections, but those will disappear after the 1 minute time window (the default lookback period) of the graph elapses.
====

image::inventlry-vs-delay-kiali.png[fault-injection,700]

Click on the "edge" (the line between `istio-ingressgateway` and `inventory`) and then scroll to the bottom of the right-side graph showing the _HTTP Request Response Time_. Hover over the black _average_ data point to confirm that the average response time is about 5000ms (5 seconds) as expected:

image::5sdelay.png[delay, 800]

If the Inventory’s front page was set to correctly handle delays, we expect it to load within approximately 5 seconds. To see the web page response times, open the Developer Tools menu in IE, Chrome or Firefox (typically, key combination kbd:[CTRL+SHIFT+I] or kbd:[CMD+ALT+I] on a Mac), select the `Network` tab, and reload the inventory web page.

You will see and feel that the webpage loads in about 5 seconds:

image::inventory-webui-delay.png[Delay, 700]

Before we will move to the next step, clean up the fault injection and set the default virtual service once again using these commands in a Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete virtualservice/inventory-fault-delay -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory && \
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/inventory/rules/inventory-default.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

Also, close the tabs in your browser for the Inventory and Catalog services to avoid unnecessary load, and stop the endless `for` loop you started in the beginning of this lab in CodeReady by closing the Terminal window that was running it.

=== 3. Enable Circuit Breaker

In this step, you will configure a circuit Breaker to protect the calls to `Inventory` service. If the `Inventory` service gets overloaded due to call volume, Istio will limit future calls to the service instances to allow them to recover.

Circuit breaking is a critical component of distributed systems. It’s nearly always better to fail quickly and apply back pressure upstream as soon as possible. Istio enforces circuit breaking limits at the network level as opposed to having to configure and code each application independently.

Istio supports various types of conditions that would trigger a circuit break:

* *Cluster maximum connections*: The maximum number of connections that Istio will establish to all hosts in a cluster.

* *Cluster maximum pending requests*: The maximum number of requests that will be queued while waiting for a ready connection pool connection.

* *Cluster maximum requests*: The maximum number of requests that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time. In practice this is applicable to HTTP/2 clusters since HTTP/1.1 clusters are governed by the maximum connections circuit breaker.

* *Cluster maximum active retries*: The maximum number of retries that
can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time. In general Istio recommends aggressively circuit breaking retries so that retries for sporadic failures are allowed but the overall retry volume cannot explode and cause large scale cascading failure.

[NOTE]
====
that *HTTP2* uses a single connection and never queues (always multiplexes), so max connections and max pending requests are not applicable.
====

Each circuit breaking limit is configurable and tracked on a per upstream cluster and per priority basis. This allows different components of the distributed system to be tuned independently and have different limits. See the https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/circuit_breaking[Envoy’s circuit breaker^] for more details.

Let’s add a circuit breaker to the calls to the *Inventory service*. Instead of using a _VirtualService_ object, circuit breakers in Istio are defined as _DestinationRule_ objects. DestinationRule defines policies that apply to traffic intended for a service after routing has occurred. These rules specify configuration for load balancing, connection pool size from the sidecar, and outlier detection settings to detect and evict unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.

Open the empty *inventory-cb.yaml* file in _inventory/rules_ directory and add this code to the file to enable circuit breaking when calling the Inventory service:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: inventory-cb
spec:
  host: inventory
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      tcp:
        maxConnections: 1
      http:
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 1
        maxRequestsPerConnection: 1
----

Run the following command via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal to then create the rule:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/inventory/rules/inventory-cb.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory
----

We set the Inventory service’s maximum connections to 1 and maximum pending requests to 1. Thus, if we send more than 2 requests within a short period of time to the inventory service, 1 will go through, 1 will be pending, and any additional requests will be denied until the pending request is processed. Furthermore, it will detect any hosts that return a server error (HTTP 5xx) and eject the pod out of the load balancing pool for 15 minutes. You can visit here to check the https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/circuit-breaking[Istio spec^] for more details on what each configuration
parameter does.

=== 4. Overload the service

We'll use a utility called _siege_ to send multiple concurrent requests to our application, and witness the circuit breaker kicking in and opening the circuit.

Execute this to simulate a number of users attempting to access the gateway URL simultaneously in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
siege --verbose --time=1M --concurrent=10 'http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}'
----

This will run for 1 minute, and you'll likely encounter errors like `[error] Failed to make an SSL connection: 5` which indicates that the circuit breaker is tripping and stopping the flood of requests from going to the service.

To see this, open the https://grafana-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/d/LJ_uJAvmk/istio-service-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=10s&var-service=inventory.{{ USER_ID }}-inventory.svc.cluster.local&var-srcns=All&var-srcwl=All&var-dstns=All&var-dstwl=All[Istio Service Dashboard^] in Grafana and ensure to see _Client Success Rate(non-5xx responses)_ of inventory service is no longer at 100%:

[NOTE]
====
It may take 10-20 seconds before the evidence of the circuit breaker is visible within the Grafana dashboard, due to the not-quite-realtime nature of Prometheus metrics and Grafana refresh periods and general network latency. You can also re-run the `siege` command to force more failures.
====

image::inventory-circuit-breaker-grafana.png[circuit-breaker, 700]

That’s the circuit breaker in action, limiting the number of requests to the service. In practice your limits would be much higher.

You can also see the Circuit Breaker triggering `HTTP 503` errors in the animation:

image::inventory-circuit-breaker-kiali.png[circuit-breaker, 700]

In practice, these `503` errors would trigger upstream fallbacks while the overloaded service is given a chance to recover.

Before we move on the next step, clear existing _destinationrule_, _virtural service_ and _gateway_ via the following commands.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete destinationrule/inventory-cb -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory && \
oc delete virtualservice/inventory-default -n {{ USER_ID }}-inventory && \
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/catalog/rules/catalog-default.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
----

=== 6. Enable Authentication using Single Sign-on

In this step, you will learn how to enable authentication. You will secure the _Catalog_ endpoint. We will use JWT with Red Hat Single Sign On which is part of the Red Hat Runtimes.

References:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token[JSON Web Token(JWT)^]
* https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat Single Sign-On^]
* https://www.redhat.com/en/products/application-runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^]

Let’s deploy *Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO)* that enables service authentication for traffic in the service mesh.

_Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO)_ is based on the *Keycloak* project and enables you to secure your web applications by providing Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities based on popular standards such as *SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0*. The RH-SSO server can act as a SAML or OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider, mediating with your enterprise user directory or 3rd-party SSO provider for identity information and your applications via standards-based tokens. The major features include:

* *Authentication Server* - Acts as a standalone SAML or OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider.
* *User Federation* - Certified with LDAP servers and Microsoft Active Directory as sources for user information.
* *Identity Brokering* - Integrates with 3rd-party Identity Providers including leading social networks as identity source.
* *REST APIs and Administration GUI* - Specify user federation, role mapping, and client applications with easy-to-use Administration GUI and REST APIs.

We will deploy RH-SSO in a new project. Go to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-catalog[Topology View^], click on *Create Project*:

image::create_project_topology.png[rhsso, 500]

Type the following name then click on *Create*:

 * Name: `{{ USER_ID}}-rhsso`

image::create_project_popup.png[rhsso, 500]

Click on *From Catalog* in Topology view:

image::create_project_fc.png[rhsso, 700]

Add the following labels in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{ USER_ID}}-rhsso && \
oc label dc/sso app.openshift.io/runtime=sso && \
oc label dc/sso-postgresql app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql --overwrite && \
oc label dc/sso-postgresql app.kubernetes.io/part-of=sso --overwrite && \
oc label dc/sso app.kubernetes.io/part-of=sso --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/sso-postgresql app.openshift.io/connects-to=sso --overwrite
----

Go back to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-rhsso[Topology View^]:

image::rhsso-topology.png[sso, 700]

Once this finishes (it may take a minute or two), click on https://secure-sso-{{ USER_ID }}-rhsso.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}[Secure SSO Route^] to access RH-SSO web console as below:

image::rhsso_landing_page.png[sso, 700]

Click on _Administration Console_ to configure *Istio* Ream then input the usename and password that you used earlier:

* Username or email: `admin`
* Password: `admin`

image::rhsso_admin_login.png[sso, 700]

You will see general information of the _Istio Realm_. Click on *Login* tab and de-select (swich off) _Require SSL_ by setting it to _none_ then click on *Save*.

image::rhsso_istio_realm.png[sso, 700]

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Single Sign-On generates a self-signed certificate the first time it runs. Please note that self-signed certificates don’t work to authenticate by Istio so we will change not to use SSL for testing Istio authentication.
====

Next, create a new RH-SSO _client_ that is for trusted browser apps and web services in our _Istio_ realm. Go to *Clients* in the left menu then click on *Create*.

image::rhsso_clients.png[sso, 700]

Input `ccn-cli` in _Client ID_ field and click on *Save*.

image::rhsso_clients_create.png[sso, 700]

On the next screen, you will see details on the *Settings* tab, the only thing you need to do is to input _Valid Redirect URIs_ that can be used after successful login or logout for clients.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/*
----

image::rhsso_clients_settings.png[sso, 700]

Don’t forget to click *Save*!

Now, let’s define a role that will be assigned to your credentials, let’s create a simple role called *ccn_auth*. Go to *Roles* in the left menu then click on _Add Role_.

image::rhsso_roles.png[sso, 700]

Input `ccn_auth` in _Role Name_ field and click on *Save*.

image::rhsso_roles_create.png[sso, 700]

Next let’s update the password policy for our _authuser_.

Go to *Users* menu on the left side menu then click on *View all users*.

image::rhsso_users.png[sso, 700]

If you click on the `auth{{ USER_ID }}` ID then you will find more information such as Details, Attributes, Credentials, Role Mappings, Groups, Contents, and Sessions. You don’t need to update any details in this step.

image::rhsso_istio_users_details.png[sso, 700]

Go to *Credentials* tab and input the following variables:

* New Password: `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`
* Password Confirmation: `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`
* Temporary: `OFF`

Make sure to turn off the *Temporary* flag unless you want the auth{{ USER_ID }} to have to change his password the first time they authenticate.

Click on *Reset Password*.

image::rhsso_users_credentials.png[sso, 700]

Then click on *Change password* in the popup window.

image::rhsso_users_change_pwd.png[sso, 700]

Now proceed to the *Role Mappings* tab and assign the role *ccn_auth* via clicking on _Add selected >_.

image::rhsso_rolemapping.png[sso, 700]

You will confirm the ccn_auth role in _Assigned Roles_ box.

image::rhsso_rolemapping_assigned.png[sso, 700]

Well done, you have enabled RH-SSO to with a custom realm, user and role!

==== Rename services

In upcoming versions of OpenShift Service Mesh, newer versions of Istio will https://istio.io/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/protocol-selection/#automatic-protocol-selection[auto-detect protocols^] like `http`. But for now, we must explicitly include the protocol name in our Kubernetes service names so that we can do advanced things like apply authentication and authorization policies. To do that, run the following commands to update the service names for both catalog and inventory:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc patch -n {{ USER_ID }}-catalog svc/catalog-springboot -p '{"spec": {"ports":[{"port": 8080, "name": "http"}, {"port": 8443, "name": "https"}]}}'
----

Turning to back to Istio, let’s create a user-facing authentication policy using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and the https://openid.net/connect/[OIDC^] authenticaiton flow.

In CodeReady, open the empty *ccn-auth-config.yml* file in _catalog/rules_ directory to copy the following _RequestAuthentication_ and _AuthorizationPolicy_:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: calalog-req-auth
  namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      deploymentconfig: catalog-springboot
  jwtRules:
  - issuer: http://sso-{{ USER_ID }}-rhsso.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/auth/realms/istio
    jwksUri: http://sso-{{ USER_ID }}-rhsso.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/auth/realms/istio/protocol/openid-connect/certs
---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: catalog-auth-policy
  namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      deploymentconfig: catalog-springboot
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        requestPrincipals: ["*"]
----

The following fields are used above to create a _RequestAuthentication_ in Istio and are described here:

* *issuer* - Identifies the issuer that issued the JWT. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1[issuer^] usually a URL or an email address.
* *jwksUri* - URL of the provider’s public key set to validate signature of the JWT.

Then execute the following oc command in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal to create this object:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m3-labs/catalog/rules/ccn-auth-config.yaml -n {{ USER_ID }}-catalog
----

Now you can’t access the catalog service without authentication of RH-SSO. You confirm it using the following curl command in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -i http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}
----

You should get and `HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` and `RBAC: access denied` messages.

The expected response is here because the user has not been identified with a valid JWT token in RH-SSO. It normally takes `5 ~ 10 seconds` to initialize the authentication policy in Istio Mixer. After this things go quickly as policies are cached for some period of time.

image::rhsso_call_catalog_noauth.png[sso, 900]

In order to generate a correct token, run next `curl` request in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal. This command will store the output Authorization token from RH-SSO in an environment variable called *TOKEN*.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
export TOKEN=$( curl -s -X POST 'http://sso-{{ USER_ID }}-rhsso.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/auth/realms/istio/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
 -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
 -d "username=auth{{ USER_ID }}" \
 -d 'password={{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}' \
 -d 'grant_type=password' \
 -d 'client_id=ccn-cli' | jq -r '.access_token')  && echo $TOKEN;
----

Once you have generated the token, re-run the curl command below with the token in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://istio-ingressgateway-{{ USER_ID }}-istio-system.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/services/products | jq
----

You should see the following expected output:

[source,json]
----
...
 {
    "itemId": "444435",
    "name": "Quarkus twill cap",
    "desc": "",
    "price": 13,
    "quantity": 600
  },
  {
    "itemId": "444437",
    "name": "Nanobloc Universal Webcam Cover",
    "desc": "",
    "price": 2.75,
    "quantity": 230
  }
]
----

Congratulations! You’ve integrated RH-SSO with Istio to protect service mesh traffic to the catalog service, without having to change the application at all. Istio can use Keycloak to authenticate service-to-service calls (also called "east-west" traffic).

For "north-south" traffic, such as traffic coming in from a frontend web application, RH-SSO provides https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/securing_applications_and_services_guide/openid_connect_3[various adapters^] for apps like Spring Boot, JBoss EAP and others to configure your apps to authenticate against RH-SSO. Quarkus also provides MicroProfile JWT and Keycloak adapters for those types of apps. See the https://quarkus.io/guides[Quarkus Guides^] for more detail.

*Red Hat* also offers https://access.redhat.com/products/quarkus[Red Hat build of Quarkus(RHBQ)^] to support and maintenance over stated time periods for the major versions of Quarkus. In this workhop, we use RHBQ to develop cloud-native microservices. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_quarkus[Learn more about RHBQ^]. This is one of the cloud-native runtimes included in https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^].

When combining Red Hat SSO with istio, you can ensure traffic within the service mesh and traffic coming and leaving the mesh can be properly authenticated.

=== Summary

In this scenario you used Istio to implement many of the features needed in modern, distributed applications.

Istio provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more without requiring any changes in service code. You add Istio support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices, configured and managed using Istio’s control plane functionality.

Technologies like containers and container orchestration platforms like OpenShift solve the deployment of our distributed applications quite well, but are still catching up to addressing the service communication necessary to fully take advantage of distributed microservice applications. With Istio you can solve many of these issues outside of your business logic, freeing you as a developer from concerns that belong in the infrastructure.

*Congratulations!*
